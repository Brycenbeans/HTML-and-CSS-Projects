# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
Projects I've completed on this course:

 - [Hamster Space Station Website](https://github.com/Brycenbeans/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/spacestationproject/project)
 *A silly one page website demonstrating animations in CSS*
 - [PDX Cinema website](https://github.com/Brycenbeans/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/Bootstrap4_projects)
 *Another facetious website utilizing bootstrap*

Thanks for looking!
